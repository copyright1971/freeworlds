# The Development of the Free Worlds

[Free Worlds](https://freeworlds.dev "Visit the site.") is an [open source](https://copyleft.org "The notion of an open source, or 'copyleft,' license.") [TTRPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game "What's a TRPG?"). Some might call it a [heartbreaker](http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/9/ "What's a hreatbreaker?"), and maybe it is; I'm ok with that. I've been playing D&D and similar games (as both a player and a DM) for close to 40 years, and I've been thinking about this project and taking notes for the last four. I have a vision for a game that takes the best of the genre, introduces some new elements to fix the things I don't love, and is something more traditionally open source than the OGL. (See license details below.)

The intent is that this project will take the form of a web site, which you can browse by viewing the index file or visiting https://freeworlds.dev. You will be able to clone the site on Github or download it locally. It is licensed (for now, at least) as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ "License details."). I may decide later on to remove the share-alike requirement. But, fundamentally, I prefer the copyleft scheme and want to insure that, if there are any outside contributions to Free Worlds, such work is not lost and is instead contributed back to the community.

Finally, a disclaimer: I'm notoriously bad at following through with my hobby projects. I've started and abandoned a personal blog, other web site ideas, and multiple development projects many, many times over the years. I can only promise you that I care about this and would love to see it work out, but I can't promise the amount of time or follow-through I will actually give to it. If this turns out to be yet another half-thought out and abandoned project, I highly doubt you (devoted reader) had the chance to become invested in it. And if it actually does see some followers, well, it is open source, after all.
